Monetization notes

  [UI note]
  - a 'page' is a set of 5;
    a passed question is NOT immediately slotted-out,
    instead marked pass and remains; after next-page, 
    can be found in passed. Thus, answers remain
    visible on page, after asking, and are not pushed
    out until next-page action. This changes the conceptual
    user workflow from an infinite churning queue to a
    nicely chunked set, giving it a better mental volume

  - award 300 c (30 pages) at signup
  - award 120 c (12 pages) daily at 7 pm
    (MVP: server time, later: user time)
  - donate 2 c per choice
  - passes are free
  - award 10 c for 5 everyone-knows in a row
    in a row, rather than across pages, allows
    users to develop strategies, making the exercise
    more fun and also giving an implied incentive by merit
    of reduced strategic cost to answer counter-everyone
    right after earning a dime
  - Award author 100 c when their question
    reaches 1000 c, and again at 2,000, at 3,000, and so on
  - Donate c to any question freely at any time
    UI for this should be directly on questions,
    equally visible as basic actions

  - purchase 100c/$ for $1-2,
             120c/$ for $3-4,
             140c/$ for $5+
  - optional silver nametag for lifetime spending $5+
  - optional gold nametag for lifetime spending $25+

  - Question create cost 5c up to 10/day,
    doubling for each next 10 to a max of 80,
    re-setting daily at 7 pm.
  - Pushdowns/Thieveries/???
    cost 350c to take 100 cents from a question
    for yourself
  - Label bottom 2 answer slots in create +1c


IFAQ

Can I exchange my everyone-knows cents for real money?

NO!

We award 120 c/day to each user,
which is 3600 c/month.

There is no way we could support changing cents to
real money unless the government gave us permission
to print money, which we would like them to, but
don't think is very likely.

Your real-money donations can be refunded within
one week, provided you have sufficient cents
still on hand.
