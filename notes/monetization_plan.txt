Monetization notes

  [UI note]
  - a 'page' is a set of 5;
    a passed question is NOT immediately slotted-out,
    instead marked pass and remains; after next-page, 
    can be found in passed. Thus, answers remain
    visible on page, after asking, and are not pushed
    out until next-page action. This changes the conceptual
    user workflow from an infinite churning queue to a
    nicely chunked set, giving it a better mental volume

  - award 250 c (25 pages) at signup
  - award 120 c (12 pages) daily at 7 pm
    (MVP: server time, later: user time)
  - donate 2 c per choice
  - passes are free
  - award 10 c for 5 everyone-knows in a row
    in a row, rather than across pages, allows
    users to develop strategies, making the exercise
    more fun and also giving an implied incentive by merit
    of reduced strategic cost to answer counter-everyone
    right after earning a dime
  - Award author 100 c when their question
    reaches 1000 c, and again at 2,000, at 3,000, and so on
  - Donate c to any question freely at any time
    UI for this should be directly on questions,
    equally visible as basic actions

  - purchase 100c/$ for $1-2,
             120c/$ for $3-4,
             140c/$ for $5+
  - optional silver nametag for lifetime spending $5+
  - optional gold nametag for lifetime spending $25+

  - Question create cost 5 c
  - Label bottom 2 answer slots in create +1c
