Question.get_unseen_for
will need to respect the current page,
so we CANNOT rerun a DB query on each load;

The app either needs to save necessary information about
its own view state across refreshes or to use the DB to
hold some information about the view state, e.g. the current
five.

For MVP, this is not the worst thing; we will
allow Refreshing to fetch new questions as long
as click actions (voicing, passing, donating)
never unexpectedly cause a new fetch.

Clicking X also causes the window to expand or collapse;
this should be prevented
