the index page needs to know
  - each question and its choices

the index page also needs to know, and be able to respond to changes client-side (with JavaScript), to
  - the users' current voice for each question

  Method 1: 

  request Question IDs and associated Choice IDs for the view first

  Using IN clause on Question IDs, request users' Voices 

  before sending data to front-end, package in a hash keyed on Question IDs for easy access of data under each question
